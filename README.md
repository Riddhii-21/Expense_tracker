# Expense_tracker
An expense tracker is a desktop application that keeps track of all your expenses and stores all the information regarding them, including the person to whom you have paid the money (also called payee) and the reason why you paid the money.
The objective of this project is to create a GUI based Expense Tracker. To build this, you will need an intermediate understanding of the Tkinter library, SQL language and its commands, and basic understanding of messagebox module, ttk.Treeview widget and tkcalender library.
